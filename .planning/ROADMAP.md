**Research**: Likely (game state cloning strategies, move pruning heuristics)
**Plans**: 3/4 complete

Plans:
- [x] 28.1-01: Command undo infrastructure (inverse generation, undoCommand, Game.undoLastCommand)

3. **Transposition tables** - Cache evaluated positions to avoid redundant computation
4. **Parallel MCTS** - Web Workers for multi-core tree search

**Success criteria:** MCTS can run 10x more iterations in the same time budget, producing noticeably better play.

### 🚧 v1.1 MCTS Strategy Improvements (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Make MCTS AI play strategically better by adding lookahead, threat detection, and advanced search techniques. Each phase is tested against Hex AI - if no improvement, revert and skip.

**Testing Protocol:** Each phase runs benchmark (40+ AI vs AI games), measures win rate distribution, game length, and response time. Success = measurable improvement or theoretical foundation for later phases.

#### Phase 29: playout-lookahead ✅
**Goal**: Enable simulation lookahead (playoutDepth > 0) so AI can discover forcing sequences
**Depends on**: Phase 28.1
**Research**: Unlikely (parameter change)
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

Plans:
- [x] 29-01: Change playoutDepth from 0 to 3-5 in difficulty presets

**Results:** P1 win rate improved from 40% to 57.5%, games 30% longer (more contested), response time improved.

#### Phase 30: threat-response ✅

**Depends on**: Phase 29
**Research**: Unlikely (internal MCTS enhancement)
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

Plans:
- [x] 30-01: Add threatResponseMoves hook, Hex blocking detection, session wiring

#### Phase 30.1: improve-generate-ai (INSERTED) ✅
**Goal**: Improve `/generate-ai` slash command based on lessons from Hex AI debugging
**Depends on**: Phase 30
**Research**: Unlikely (leveraging existing implementation learnings)
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

Plans:
- [x] 30.1-01: Add threat response, playout policy, and human testing to /generate-ai

**Details:**
Key lessons from Hex AI that `/generate-ai` should incorporate:
1. **Threat response is critical** - Games need blocking/defensive move detection, not just offensive evaluation
2. **Playout policy matters** - Random playouts produce random-looking play; weighted playouts based on connectivity/position improve quality
3. **Move sampling can hide critical moves** - If threat response happens AFTER sampling, blocking moves may be filtered out
4. **Path-based analysis for connection games** - Dijkstra shortest-path provides concrete threat detection thresholds
5. **Test against human strategies** - AI vs AI benchmarks don't catch simple human exploits (straight lines in Hex)

The command should guide Claude to:
- Analyze the game type and identify what "threats" look like
- Generate threat detection functions that integrate properly with MCTS sampling
- Create playout policies that bias toward strategically sound moves
- Include human-style exploit testing, not just AI vs AI benchmarks

#### Phase 31: trajectory-objectives ✅
**Goal**: Add feature templates that detect momentum/trajectory, not just static state
**Depends on**: Phase 30
**Research**: Unlikely (feature template addition)
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

#### Phase 32: move-ordering ✅
**Goal**: Prioritize exploring moves near opponent's pieces/recent activity
**Depends on**: Phase 31
**Research**: Unlikely (move sorting heuristic)
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

Plans:
- [x] 32-01: Add moveOrdering hook to AIConfig, implement for Hex

#### Phase 33: rave ✅
**Goal**: Implement RAVE (Rapid Action Value Estimation) to learn from all simulations
**Depends on**: Phase 32
**Research**: Unlikely (well-documented algorithm)
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

Plans:
- [x] 33-01: Add RAVE data structures, move tracking, UCT-RAVE selection

#### Phase 34: gradient-objectives
**Goal**: Change objectives from boolean to numeric for finer-grained evaluation
**Depends on**: Phase 33
**Research**: Unlikely (interface change)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 34-01: TBD

#### Phase 35: dynamic-uct
**Goal**: Adjust UCT exploration constant based on game phase
**Depends on**: Phase 34
**Research**: Likely (needs parameter tuning research)
**Research topics**: Optimal C values per game type, phase detection strategies
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 35-01: TBD

#### Phase 36: proof-number-search
**Goal**: Detect forced wins/losses that MCTS might miss using PN search
**Depends on**: Phase 35

Plans:
- [ ] 36-01: TBD
