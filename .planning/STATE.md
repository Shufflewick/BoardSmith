Backlog for a future cribbage (v2 CRIB) milestone: R-05 (suppress Undo during guided tutorial steps), R-12 (strategy tutorial track), pit-of-success lint/dev-warning when a custom board omits `anchorAttrs`. Repo-wide: 2 pre-existing eslint no-shadow errors (useFlyingElements.ts) + tsc test-file looseness — future cleanup pass.

Carried forward from v4.0 (still deferred, separate repo): ShufflewickPub host skin (HOST-01..04).

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- v4.5 roadmap defined (2026-07-02): 9 phases (131-139), 42 requirements (PROC, SEC, ENG, RST, SESS, UIX, CLIX, SDK, TST, DOCX, GAMES) derived from 38 confirmed audit findings (`boardsmith-audit-report-3.html`, F1-F38). Continues phase numbering from v4.4 (ended at 130).
- Phase 131 (SEC+RST serialization/restore fidelity) is sequenced first: SEC-01/F1/F7 (the critical finding — zone visibility lost on every snapshot restore) and its cluster (SEC-02..04, RST-01/02) all share one root cause — constructor-applied config (`_zoneVisibility`, event handlers, `teachingDisabled`) that `loadSerializedState`/`GameSession.restore` silently discard. Fixed together at the serialization layer, not spot-patched. PROC-01/PROC-02 (verify-first discipline + regression-test-per-fix) are tracked here for traceability but apply fractally to every phase.
- Phase 132 (ENG element/builder safety) and Phase 133 (ENG flow/action validation) split the 8 ENG findings by subsystem — element-tree/builder mutation (putInto, resolveArgs, forEach, build()) vs. flow control/validation (eachPlayer, simultaneousActionStep, multiSelect, switchOn). Findings are mutually independent per audit guidance; split keeps each phase reviewable.
- Phase 134 (UI & Session Interaction Guardrails) groups SESS-01 with all 5 UIX findings — both are "silent wrong-path-that-looks-right" footguns in developer-facing composables/session accessors, distinct from the CLI/SDK footguns in Phases 135/136.
- Phase 135 (CLIX) and Phase 136 (SDK) are separate phases despite both being "config/protocol correctness" work — CLI-surface findings (dev.ts/validate.ts/init.ts) vs. client-SDK findings (game-connection.ts/client.ts/types.ts) touch disjoint subsystems with no shared root cause.
- Phase 137 (TST) is a small, self-contained phase — TestGame.doAction/seed defaults, matching the library's existing determinism doctrine established in v4.4 Phase 123.
- Phase 138 (GAMES cross-repo migration) is sequenced after all API-changing phases (131-137) are stable, mirroring v4.3 Phase 121 and v4.4 Phase 129.
- Phase 139 (DOCX audit) is last: fixes the 3 pure-docs findings (F11/F14/F20) and grep-verifies every doc touched by phases 131-138 (DOCX-04), mirroring v4.4 Phase 130's doc-verifier pass.
- Coverage: 42/42 requirements mapped, no orphans, no duplicates (see REQUIREMENTS.md Traceability table).

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v4.5 roadmap]: SEC+RST cluster fixed together at the serialization layer (Phase 131) rather than spot-patched per finding — shared root cause (constructor-applied config discarded by loadSerializedState/restore).
- [v4.5 roadmap]: ENG findings split across two phases by subsystem (element/builder vs. flow/action) rather than one large engine phase — keeps fine-granularity phases independently reviewable.
- [v4.5 roadmap]: GAMES migration sequenced after ALL API-changing phases (131-137), not just some — every prior phase can introduce breaking changes per the No Backward Compatibility rule.
- [Phase 131]: PROC-01 verification gate: all 7 findings (F1,F2,F7,F8,F10,F15,F16) confirmed LEGITIMATE — Independent file:line re-trace before any fix; stateless-ops.ts explicitly confirmed to need no fix for F15
- [Phase 131-02]: Zone-visibility restore tests must use a plain Space (not Deck/Hand): those classes reapply their own constructor default on restore, masking the F1/F7 bug for the common case
- [Phase 131]: debugEnabled is GameSession-consumer-only (not persisted/CLI-wired, Pitfall 2); added GameSession.displayName/teachingDisabled getters (Rule 2) to make the RST-02 persistence fix observable/testable — Session-scoped host-policy fields mirror the aiConfig round-trip pattern; debug gating opt-in stays scoped to trusted GameSession consumers, matching 131-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 2
- [Phase 131-04]: visibleAttributes filtering lives inside filterElement's existing fallthrough (single chokepoint, no parallel filter); state.players derived from truthView via findElementJSONById instead of raw player.toJSON()
- [Phase 131]: Event handler identity key = class name + branch() (tree index path); stable because fromJSON rebuilds children in the same order they were serialized.
- [Phase 132-01]: PROC-01 gate: all four findings (F3/ENG-01, F12/ENG-05, F13/ENG-06, F28/ENG-08) independently re-verified LEGITIMATE against current source before any fix
- [Phase 132-02]: Self-move error message includes the word 'descendant' (trivially its own descendant) so self and true-descendant cases share one actionable-error shape and one test regex
- [Phase 132-02]: ENG-01 containment guard kept fully separate from WR-03 (not merged) -- preserves WR-03's distinct dev-only detached-destination diagnostic purpose
- [Phase 132-03]: resolveArgs second pass narrowed to isSerializedElement only, no bare-number coercion outside declared selections; first pass untouched
- [Phase 132-03]: collect fixtures updated to resolve followUp ids explicitly via game.getElementById, matching the newly documented followUp-arg resolution pattern
- [Phase 132-04]: GameElement forEach snapshot items tagged with { elementId } wrapper (not bare number) to avoid the ENG-05/resolveArgs ambiguity between element ids and JSON-primitive numbers in the same collection
- [Phase 132]: handlerless flag set true in Action constructor, cleared inside .execute(fn); registerAction() throw kept separate from startFlow validators (new registration-time gate per Pitfall 4)
- [Phase 133-01]: PROC-01 gate satisfied — all four findings (F4/ENG-02, F5/ENG-03, F6/ENG-04, F27/ENG-07) independently re-verified LEGITIMATE against current post-Phase-132 source with current file:line evidence before any fix; verification document delivered across two atomic commits matching the plan's two-task structure
- [Phase 133-02]: Wrap is unconditional, no wrap:false opt-out — truncation was never a sane board-game semantic
- [Phase 133-02]: No startIndex === 0 special case added; slice(0)+slice(0,0) degenerates naturally to the full list
- [Phase ?]: Phase 133-04: choice-branch multiSelect enforcement ported from elements branch with deliberate non-array-rejection divergence per locked ENG-04 decision
- [Phase 133-03]: resumeSimultaneousAction's allDone-gated awaitingInput/awaitingPlayers clearing kept fully separate from the actionError set/clear mirror -- structurally different completion semantics from resume()'s single-player completion
- [Phase 133-05]: Used generalized switchOn error message baseline (no name prefix required) with optional config.name prefix, matching the loop maxIterations precedent without requiring callers to set name
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 134-01]: PROC-01 gate satisfied -- all six findings (F17/UIX-01, F18/UIX-02, F19/UIX-03, F29/SESS-01, F30/UIX-04, F31/UIX-05) independently re-verified LEGITIMATE against current post-Phase-133 source with fresh file:line evidence; F19's structural-CSS-fix alternative independently re-confirmed REJECTED; F29's #runner assignment sites re-confirmed at 5 (341, 379, 484, 1462, 1482)
- [Phase 134-02]: start() success path returns bare {success:true} with JSDoc explicitly noting it reflects only synchronous pre-checks, not the eventual server result (RESEARCH.md Pitfall 1)
- [Phase 134-02]: fill()'s UIX-02 multiSelect guard placed after choice-object unwrap and before repeat/onSelect routing, reusing resolveMultiSelectConfig verbatim (no re-derivation)
- [Phase 134-02]: beforeAutoExecuteHooks uses a plain array + identity-based unregister closure (Ref<Hook[]>), matching 134-PATTERNS.md Pattern 2 rather than a new registry abstraction
- [Phase 134-03]: GameShell lastError watch keeps a defensive UIX-01 fallback branch even though useActionController already coalesces lastError to a non-empty string on every failure; unreachable in practice but documents the contract and is test-covered
- [Phase 134-03]: drag()'s combined helper calls a new internal dragPropsInner() directly rather than the now when-gated public dragProps(), avoiding a DragResult.props type break
