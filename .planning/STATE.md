# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-25)

## Current Position

Phase: 107 (ai-assisted-teaching) — COMPLETE
Plan: 4 of 4
Status: Phase complete — 4/4 plans done; AI-01/02/03 requirements fulfilled
Last activity: 2026-06-26

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- v4.1 roadmap derives 7 substrate-first phases (104–110) from 15 v1 requirements. The TUT substrate (104–106) is foundational and must land before the checkers showcase (CHK, Phase 109) and the AI hint (AI-01, Phase 107).
- Phase 104 (lifecycle + action gating) is the engine/session base; Phase 105 (annotation overlay) is the UI base; Phase 106 (predicate triggers + CI-verifiable authoring) completes authoring.
- The annotation overlay (TUT-01, Phase 105) has a HARD parity constraint — it MUST route through `useBoardInteraction` so it works identically in custom UI and AutoUI (project hard-rule).
- CI-verifiable authoring via the `testing` DSL (TUT-04, Phase 106) lands before/alongside CHK so the checkers tutorial is authored as a verifiable artifact, not retrofitted.
- AI-01/02/03 (Phase 107) reuse checkers' EXISTING MCTS bot (`~/BoardSmithGames/checkers/src/rules/ai.ts`) — no new training; the work is surfacing existing evaluations to the UI.
- CHK-* (Phase 109) authored cross-repo in `~/BoardSmithGames/checkers` (symlinked to this repo's node_modules) while the substrate lands in this repo's `src/`.
- DEMO-01 (Phase 110) is the FINAL phase — the user's explicit "demonstrate to me so we can refine" gate, browser-verified end-to-end, before the future cribbage (CRIB) milestone.

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v4.1 roadmap decisions (2026-06-25):**

- Substrate-first sequencing: engine/session lifecycle+gating (104) → UI overlay (105) → triggers + CI-authoring (106) → teaching layers (107 AI, 108 HELP) → checkers showcase (109) → demo gate (110).
- TUT-01 annotation overlay must route through `useBoardInteraction` for custom-UI/AutoUI parity (hard-rule), verified in both UI paths.
- Action gating (TUT-02) reuses the engine's existing action validation and the v2.8 disabled-reason surface — no parallel validation path.
- AI teaching features reuse checkers' existing MCTS; no new training/weights.
- Checkers tutorial content (CHK-*) lands cross-repo in `~/BoardSmithGames/checkers`; substrate stays in this repo's `src/`.
- DEMO-01 framed as a refinement checkpoint, not a sign-off — captured friction feeds the substrate before cribbage (v2 CRIB).

**Phase 107 UI decisions (2026-06-26):**

- overlay-utils.ts dedup: cssEscape + buildSelector extracted from TutorialOverlay to shared module — zero copy-paste across overlay components.
- isDemoRunning tracked as local ref in GameShell — session getter not broadcast; cleared on flowState.complete.
- Teaching controls wired via platformRequest ops (hint/demo-start/demo-stop/heatmap-toggle) — bridge integration deferred to Phase 109.
- showHintProp computed from lobbyInfo AI slots — cleanest client-side AI detection; platform mode hidden (Phase 110 wires production).
- Parity proven at component level: dual-fixture tests (custom-UI-like div vs AutoUI-grid-like table cell, same data-bs-el-id) in both HintOverlay and HeatmapOverlay test suites.

### Highest-Risk Items

1. `useBoardInteraction` parity for the annotation overlay (Phase 105) — a primitive that works in only one UI path violates the hard-rule; verify both paths.
2. Tutorial progress serialization round-trip (Phase 104) — must be checkpoint/replay safe like prior engine state.
3. CI-verifiable authoring (Phase 106) — the test must actually fail on a broken rule, not pass vacuously; prove with a deliberately broken rule.
4. Cross-repo authoring (Phase 109) — substrate in `src/` vs content in `~/BoardSmithGames/checkers`; keep the symlinked dev loop green.

### Pending Todos

Carried from v4.0 (non-blocking): dev-standalone shell height gap; pre-existing dev-host AI-turn issue; orphaned tokens / lint scope / focus-ring naming / platform-mode connection-announce seam. See `.planning/todos/pending/`.

**Carry-forward from Phase 104 code review (Medium/Low — address in the consuming phase, see 104-REVIEW.md):**

- **MR-01 → ✅ CLOSED in Phase 105:** `tutorialStep` threaded into `useActionController` via GameShell production wiring; behavioral suppress-auto-fill test guards it. Phase 105 review also fixed BL-01 (action/panel targets were dead → overlay now teleports to body + `position:fixed` + `document.querySelector`, highlights targets in `.actionbar` outside `.boardregion`), CR-01 (bubble announced — root aria-hidden removed), WR-01/WR-02. Suite 1371 green.
- **MR-02 → Phase 106:** predicate-form gates are currently all-or-nothing/permissive; flesh out when predicate triggers land.
- **LR-02 → Phase 109:** gate `from`/`to` are lumped into one set, blind to selection name — checkers "piece c3 → square d4" needs per-selection-name gating.
- **MR-03 / LR-01 (minor):** `start()` on empty `steps` is a silent no-op (should fail loud); `skip()` records identically to `advance()` (no distinction). Address opportunistically.

**Phase 104 pre-existing tech debt surfaced (NOT introduced by 104, out of scope):** `tsc --noEmit` reports type-looseness errors in test files this repo does not gate on `tsc` (HandRenderer.a11y, GameHistory, DebugPanel, notation-serialization). Repo gates on vitest + eslint. Candidate for a future cleanup pass.
