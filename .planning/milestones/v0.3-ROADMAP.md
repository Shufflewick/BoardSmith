  - Resume Handling (resumeSimultaneousAction)
  - Core Execution Loop (createContext, getPosition, run)
  - Node Dispatch (executeNode)
  - Flow Control Executors (sequence, loop, each-player, for-each)
  - Action Step Executors (action-step, simultaneous-action-step)
  - Conditional Executors (switch, if, execute, phase)
- Enhanced JSDoc for 3 key complex methods (run, executeActionStep, resumeSimultaneousAction)
- Section divider pattern now applied to both major engine files (MCTS Bot, FlowEngine)
