# Milestone v0.4: Public API Docs (Archived)

**Shipped:** 2026-01-09

## Summary

Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation to all public APIs in @boardsmith/engine and @boardsmith/testing packages. BoardSmith is a library, and library users need clear documentation for IDE autocompletion and understanding APIs.

## Phases

### Phase 10: public-api-jsdoc (3/3 plans)

**Goal:** Add JSDoc documentation to all public APIs

- [x] 10-01: Add JSDoc to engine element system (Game, GameElement, Space, Piece, Card, etc.)
- [x] 10-02: Add JSDoc to engine action and flow systems (Action builder, flow DSL)
- [x] 10-03: Add JSDoc to testing package (test utilities, assertions, debug)

## Key Accomplishments

**Element System (10-01):**
- Game class: constructor, lifecycle methods, action/flow registration
- GameElement class: query methods (all, first, last, has, count) with practical examples
- Element subclasses: Space, Piece, Card, Deck, Hand, Die, Grid, GridCell, HexGrid, HexCell

**Action and Flow System (10-02):**
- Action builder: chooseFrom, chooseElement, enterText, enterNumber, execute methods
- ActionExecutor: class-level JSDoc explaining role and directing users to Action builder
- FlowEngine: class-level JSDoc with usage example and responsibility list

**Testing Package (10-03):**
- TestGame class: Full @typeParam, @example, and method documentation
- Action simulation: @param/@returns for all functions, @throws for assertions
- Assertions: @throws documentation, constraint descriptions
- Fixtures: ScenarioBuilder with builder pattern docs
- Debug utilities: All functions with @param/@returns/@example
- Package index: @packageDocumentation with comprehensive usage example

## Patterns Established

- `@example` blocks with TypeScript code fences
- `@module` comments for file-level documentation
- `@packageDocumentation` for package entry point
- `@internal` for private/internal functions
- `@throws` documented for assertion functions
- `@typeParam` documented for generic classes

## Stats

- 14 files modified
- +866 / -78 lines
- 1 phase, 3 plans
- Same day start to ship (2026-01-09)

## Git Range

`docs(10-01): add JSDoc to Action builder` → `docs(10-03): complete testing package JSDoc plan`
