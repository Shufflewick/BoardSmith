## Gaps

None. All requirements satisfied, all phases verified, all integration points connected.

## Tech Debt

None accumulated during v2.0 milestone. Clean implementation.

## Conclusion

v2.0 "Collapse the Monorepo" milestone is **COMPLETE**:

1. **Single package:** BoardSmith is now a single `boardsmith` npm package with 11 subpath exports
2. **Source collapsed:** All 12 packages consolidated into `src/` (179 files, git history preserved)
3. **Tests colocated:** 16 library tests now live next to their source files
4. **Games extracted:** 9 games successfully extracted to `~/BoardSmithGames/`
5. **CLI updated:** All commands work for both monorepo and standalone contexts
6. **Documentation complete:** All docs updated, migration guide ready for external team

The milestone delivers on its definition of done with zero critical gaps and zero accumulated tech debt.
