- [x] **PKG-02**: Subpath export `boardsmith` for core engine
- [x] **PKG-03**: Subpath export `boardsmith/ui` for Vue components
- [x] **PKG-04**: Subpath export `boardsmith/session` for game session
- [x] **PKG-05**: Subpath export `boardsmith/testing` for test utilities
- [x] **PKG-06**: Subpath export `boardsmith/eslint-plugin` for ESLint rules
- [x] **PKG-07**: Subpath export `boardsmith/ai` for AI/MCTS logic
- [x] **PKG-08**: Subpath export `boardsmith/ai-trainer` for training infrastructure
- [x] **PKG-09**: Subpath export `boardsmith/client` for client runtime
- [x] **PKG-10**: Subpath export `boardsmith/server` for server runtime
- [x] **PKG-11**: Subpath export `boardsmith/runtime` for shared runtime
- [x] **PKG-12**: Subpath export `boardsmith/worker` for web worker support
- [x] **PKG-13**: npm instead of pnpm (package-lock.json, no pnpm-workspace.yaml)

### Source Organization

- [x] **SRC-01**: `src/engine/` contains core game logic (from @boardsmith/engine)
- [x] **SRC-02**: `src/ui/` contains Vue components (from @boardsmith/ui)
- [x] **SRC-03**: `src/session/` contains game session (from @boardsmith/session)
- [x] **SRC-04**: `src/cli/` contains CLI commands (from @boardsmith/cli)
- [x] **SRC-05**: `src/testing/` contains test utilities (from @boardsmith/testing)
- [x] **SRC-06**: `src/eslint-plugin/` contains ESLint rules (from eslint-plugin-boardsmith)
- [x] **SRC-07**: `src/ai/` contains AI/MCTS logic (from @boardsmith/ai)
- [x] **SRC-08**: `src/ai-trainer/` contains training (from @boardsmith/ai-trainer)
- [x] **SRC-09**: `src/client/` contains client runtime (from @boardsmith/client)
- [x] **SRC-10**: `src/server/` contains server runtime (from @boardsmith/server)
- [x] **SRC-11**: `src/runtime/` contains shared runtime (from @boardsmith/runtime)
- [x] **SRC-12**: `src/worker/` contains web worker (from @boardsmith/worker)
- [x] **SRC-13**: All tests colocated (*.test.ts next to source files)
- [x] **SRC-14**: Single root package.json with exports field

### Import Updates

- [x] **IMP-01**: All internal imports use relative paths within src/
- [x] **IMP-02**: No `@boardsmith/*` imports anywhere in codebase (except JSDoc examples and code-generator templates)
- [x] **IMP-03**: Cross-concern imports use relative paths (e.g., `../engine/`)

### Game Extraction

- [x] **GAME-02**: Go Fish extracted to separate git repo
- [x] **GAME-03**: Checkers extracted to separate git repo
- [x] **GAME-04**: Cribbage extracted to separate git repo
- [x] **GAME-05**: Floss Bitties extracted to separate git repo (not currently working, not a fail condition)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Backward compatibility | Clean break to v2.0, no fallbacks |
| Multiple package versions | Single version for entire library |
| Games bundled in repo | Games are separate repos |
| pnpm support | npm only for simplicity |
