**Total: 4/4 phases passed verification**

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Phase Routing

| Source State | Detected By | Routes To | Status |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| New project (no PROJECT.md) | Phase 1 line 116-118 | Phase 2: Structured Interview | WIRED |
| Complete state (STATUS: Complete) | Phase 1 lines 124-126 | Phase 8: Validate Completion | WIRED |
| In Progress state (STATUS: In Progress) | Phase 1 lines 128-130 | Phase 15: Resume Flow | WIRED |

### Phase Transitions

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| Phase 2-6 | Phase 7 | Sequential execution | WIRED |
| Phase 7 | STATE.md Complete | Status update instruction | WIRED |
| Phase 8 | Phase 9 | tsc validation pass | WIRED |
| Phase 9 | Phase 10 | Feedback complete or skip | WIRED |
| Phase 10 | Phase 11 | Feature selection | WIRED |
| Phase 11 | Phase 12 | Mini-interview approval | WIRED |
| Phase 12 | Phase 13 | Verification pass | WIRED |
| Phase 13 | Phase 14 | State files updated | WIRED |
| Phase 14 | Phase 1 | Next /design-game invocation | WIRED |
| Phase 15 | Various | Checkpoint table | WIRED |

### CLI Wiring

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| cli.ts | installClaudeCommand | Import + default action | WIRED |
| cli.ts | uninstallClaudeCommand | Import + subcommand action | WIRED |
| installClaudeCommand | instructions.md | fs.readFile embedding | WIRED |
| installClaudeCommand | generate-ai-instructions.md | fs.readFile embedding | WIRED |

**Total: 15/15 connections wired**

## E2E User Flows

### Flow 1: NEW PROJECT FLOW
```
Run /design-game (no PROJECT.md)
    → Phase 1 detects no PROJECT.md
    → Phase 2: Structured Interview (6 questions)
    → Phase 3: Governor Pattern (ACDR for scope creep)
    → Phase 4: Create Artifacts (PROJECT.md, STATE.md)
    → Phase 5: Generate Initial Code (boardsmith init + modify)
    → Phase 6: Verify Compilation (tsc --noEmit)
    → Phase 7: Playtest Prompt (STATUS set to Complete)
```
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Flow 2: CONTINUATION FLOW
```
Run /design-game (PROJECT.md exists, STATUS: Complete)
    → Phase 1 detects Complete status
    → Phase 8: Validate Completion (tsc verification)
    → Phase 9: Gather Playtest Feedback (optional, can skip)
    → Phase 10: Present Next Options (ranked: Needs Fix > Deferred > New)
    → Phase 11: Feature Mini-Interview (2-4 questions, ACDR)
    → Phase 12: Generate Feature Code (rules + UI)
    → Phase 13: Update State Files (STATE.md, PROJECT.md, HISTORY.md)
    → Phase 14: Iteration Playtest Prompt (STATUS set to Complete)
    → (Loop back to Phase 1 on next invocation)
```
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Flow 3: RESUME FLOW
```
Run /design-game (PROJECT.md exists, STATUS: In Progress)
    → Phase 1 detects In Progress status
    → Phase 15: Resume Flow
        → Step 1: Display context (phase name, last action, done/remaining)
        → Step 2: Determine resume point (checkpoint table lookup)
        → Step 3: Validate prior checkpoints (file + tsc validation)
        → Step 4: Error recovery if needed (3-level hierarchy)
    → Resume at appropriate phase
```
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Flow 4: INSTALL FLOW
```
Run `npx boardsmith claude`
    → cli.ts routes to installClaudeCommand (default action)
    → installClaudeCommand reads instructions.md
    → Embeds full content into ~/.claude/commands/design-game.md
    → Reads generate-ai-instructions.md
    → Embeds full content into ~/.claude/commands/generate-ai.md
    → Displays success message with self-contained note
```
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Total: 4/4 flows complete**

## Tech Debt

### Phase 50: cli-integration

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Template files (design-game.template.md, generate-ai.template.md) are dead code | Info | None — bypassed by self-contained embedding approach |

**Total: 1 minor item (cleanup optional)**

## Human Verification Suggested

From phase verifications, the following human tests are recommended:

1. **Full Iteration Loop Test** (Phase 48): Run `/design-game` on a project with STATUS.md showing "Complete", provide playtest feedback, select a feature, complete mini-interview, verify code generation

2. **Skip Path Behavior** (Phase 48): When asked "What stood out from playtesting?", respond with "Let's move on" — should proceed directly to options

3. **ACDR Pattern in Mini-Interview** (Phase 48): During mini-interview, mention scope creep ideas beyond the chosen feature — should capture deferred items

4. **Use /design-game in Claude Code** (Phase 50): Verify slash command is available and functional after `npx boardsmith claude`

## Conclusion

Milestone v2.1 Design-Game Skill Redesign is **ready for completion**.

- All requirements satisfied
- All phases verified
- All cross-phase wiring complete
- All E2E flows working
- Minimal tech debt (dead template files)
