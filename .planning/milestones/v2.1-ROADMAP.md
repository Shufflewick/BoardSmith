# Milestone v2.1: Design-Game Skill Redesign

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 47-50
**Total Plans:** 7

## Overview

Transform `/design-game` from a monolithic code generator into an iterative, state-driven skill that guides non-programmer game designers through building games one phase at a time.

**Core insight:** Game design is discovery — you don't know what a game needs until you playtest it. The skill should build a minimal core loop first, then add features incrementally based on playtesting feedback.

## Phases

### Phase 47: initial-interview-and-generation

**Goal**: Build the core skill flow — detect no-project state, run structured interview, generate Phase 1 code
**Requirements**: STATE-01, STATE-04, INT-01 through INT-06, GOV-01 through GOV-03, ART-01 through ART-03, GEN-01 through GEN-05
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 47-01-PLAN.md — State detection, interview flow, governor pattern
- [x] 47-02-PLAN.md — Artifact templates and code generation patterns
- [x] 47-03-PLAN.md — Template update and verification

**Success criteria**:
- `/design-game` detects no project and starts interview
- Structured prompts gather component types, turn/round/end structure
- Governor pattern defers details to backlog
- PROJECT.md and STATE.md created with game info
- Phase 1 code generated and compiles
- Designer prompted to playtest

### Phase 48: continuation-flow

**Goal**: Handle post-playtest return — gather feedback, plan next feature
**Requirements**: STATE-02, ART-04, CON-01 through CON-04
**Depends on**: Phase 47
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 48-01-PLAN.md — State validation and feedback gathering (Phases 8-9)
- [x] 48-02-PLAN.md — Feature selection, mini-interview, generation (Phases 10-14)

**Success criteria**:
- `/design-game` detects phase-complete state
- Asks about playtest results
- Shows deferred ideas as "what's next?" options
- Plans and executes single feature as next phase

### Phase 49: session-continuity

**Goal**: Resume interrupted sessions gracefully
**Requirements**: STATE-03, RES-01 through RES-03
**Depends on**: Phase 48
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 49-01-PLAN.md — Resume flow, checkpoint detection, error recovery (Phase 15)

**Success criteria**:
- `/design-game` detects mid-phase state
- Shows what was in progress
- Continues execution from where it left off
- Handles errors with clear recovery steps

### Phase 50: cli-integration

**Goal**: `npx boardsmith claude` sets up the skill and dependencies
**Requirements**: CLI-01, CLI-02
**Depends on**: Phase 49
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 50-01-PLAN.md — Default install action and self-contained messaging

**Success criteria**:
- `npx boardsmith claude` creates/updates ~/.claude/commands/design-game.md
- Skill file points to correct instructions path
- Clear guidance on GSD dependency if needed

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- 6-question interview replaces 16-question (minimal first pass, gather core loop only)
- ACDR governor pattern (Acknowledge, Capture, Defer, Redirect — preserves ideas without blocking)
- Reference files before interview (Claude needs BoardSmith context)
- boardsmith init then modify (scaffolding creates structure, Claude customizes)
- Placeholder action only in Phase 1 (real actions added based on playtest feedback)
- tsc --noEmit verification (catches errors before playtest)
- Self-contained slash commands (embed instructions, no external file reads)
- Quick Reference in instructions (condensed patterns inline)
- STATE.md is claim, artifacts are proof (validate with tsc)
- Feedback is optional with skip path (avoid interrogation feel)
- Structured feedback categories (Works/Needs Fix/Ideas)
- Silent repair protocol (fix code without asking designer)
- Ranked option presentation (Needs Fix > Deferred Ideas > New Ideas)
- Feature scope limit 3-4 requirements (larger features split)
- Every feature needs rules AND UI (must be visually playable)
- HISTORY.md 3-5 bullets per phase (prevent bloat)
- Resume without interrogation (detect state from STATE.md)
- Three-level error recovery hierarchy (recoverable, corrupt, unrecoverable)
- Checkpoint mapping tables (clear reference for resume points)
- Install as default action (boardsmith claude runs install)
- Self-contained messaging (clarify no external dependency)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Permission prompts when running /design-game (fixed with self-contained approach)
- External file reads causing friction (fixed with embedded instructions)
- CLI path bugs after monorepo collapse (fixed with multi-candidate root detection)

**Issues Deferred:**

- None — all v2.1 requirements completed

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Template files (design-game.template.md, generate-ai.template.md) are now dead code — bypassed by self-contained embedding approach
