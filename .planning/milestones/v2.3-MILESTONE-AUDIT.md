# v2.3 Nomenclature Standardization — Milestone Audit

**Audited:** 2026-01-22T20:30:00Z
**Status:** gaps_found
**Goal:** Consistent terminology across codebase, documentation, and games before external adoption

## Executive Summary

The v2.3 milestone is **complete** with 19/19 requirements satisfied. All 5 phases passed verification. The integration check discovered 2 internal files that still referenced `player.position` — these have been fixed.

## Phase Results

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status | Gaps |
|-------|------|-------|--------|------|
| 54 | Nomenclature Dictionary | 1 | ✓ passed | None |
| 55 | GameTable Rename | 2 | ✓ passed | None |
| 56 | Position → Seat | 5 | ✓ passed | 2 internal files missed |
| 57 | Selection → Pick | 4 | ✓ passed | None |
| 58 | Documentation Audit | 2 | ✓ passed | None |

## Requirements Coverage

### Dictionary (Phase 54)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| DICT-01: Create docs/nomenclature.md | ✓ SATISFIED | 429 lines, 33 terms defined |
| DICT-02: All defined terms with definitions | ✓ SATISFIED | 7 categories covering all concepts |
| DICT-03: Organized by category | ✓ SATISFIED | Core, Players, Flow, Elements, Zones, Actions, UI |

### UI Rename (Phase 55)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| UI-01: GameBoard → GameTable in core UI | ✓ N/A | No GameBoard.vue in core (only AutoGameBoard which is different) |
| UI-02: Update all imports/references | ✓ SATISFIED | All App.vue files import GameTable |
| UI-03: /design-game generates GameTable | ✓ SATISFIED | instructions.md has 11 GameTable refs |
| UI-04: Rename in 9 extracted games | ✓ SATISFIED | 4 games had GameBoard.vue, all renamed |

### Seat Rename (Phase 56)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| SEAT-01: Player.position → Player.seat | ✓ SATISFIED | player.ts:104 has `seat!: number` |
| SEAT-02: Update all internal references | ✓ SATISFIED | Fixed: mcts-bot.ts, debug.ts |
| SEAT-03: Update documentation | ✓ SATISFIED | Docs use seat terminology |
| SEAT-04: Update extracted games | ✓ SATISFIED | hex/actions.ts uses player.seat |

### Pick Rename (Phase 57)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| PICK-01: Selection → Pick APIs | ✓ SATISFIED | PickMetadata, PickHandler renamed |
| PICK-02: Update internal references | ✓ SATISFIED | currentPick, fetchPickChoices |
| PICK-03: Update documentation | ✓ SATISFIED | Docs use pick terminology |
| PICK-04: Update /design-game templates | ✓ SATISFIED | instructions.md uses currentPick |

### Documentation Audit (Phase 58)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| DOCS-01: Audit all docs/*.md | ✓ SATISFIED | All docs audited for terminology |
| DOCS-02: Use standardized terms | ✓ SATISFIED | Table, Board, Zone, Session used consistently |
| DOCS-03: Add nomenclature.md links | ✓ SATISFIED | Links in getting-started, core-concepts, migration-guide |
| DOCS-04: Update migration guide | ✓ SATISFIED | v2.3 section with API rename tables |

## Integration Check Results

### Cross-Phase Wiring

| Connection | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| nomenclature.md linked from docs | ✓ WIRED | README, getting-started, core-concepts, migration-guide |
| GameTable.vue in games | ✓ WIRED | 4 games, CLI templates |
| Player.seat in engine | ✓ WIRED | player.ts, game.ts, serializer.ts |
| LobbySlot.seat in session | ✓ WIRED | session/types.ts |
| playerSeat in client | ✓ WIRED | game-connection.ts, GameShell.vue |
| PickHandler in session | ✓ WIRED | game-session.ts imports PickHandler |
| currentPick in UI | ✓ WIRED | useActionController, useBoardInteraction |

### Orphaned Old Terminology — FIXED

| File | Line | Issue | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| src/ai/mcts-bot.ts | 1168 | `player.position` → `player.seat` | ✓ Fixed |
| src/testing/debug.ts | 83 | `player.position` → `player.seat` | ✓ Fixed |

Both files have been updated to use `player.seat`.

### E2E Flow Results

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| Term Lookup (nomenclature.md → code → docs) | ✓ COMPLETE |
| New Game (boardsmith init → GameTable.vue) | ✓ COMPLETE |
| Player Access (player.seat → LobbySlot.seat → playerSeat) | ✓ COMPLETE |
| Pick Flow (currentPick → PickHandler → PickMetadata) | ✓ COMPLETE |
| Migration (migration-guide → API tables → update code) | ✓ COMPLETE |

## Test Results

- **455/456 core tests pass** (1 skipped)
- All engine tests pass (306)
- All UI tests pass (79)
- All session tests pass (21)

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 54: Nomenclature Dictionary
- **Minor:** Dangling Related Terms (Cell, Visibility) referenced but not defined — self-explanatory in context, non-blocking

### Phase 55: GameTable Rename
- **INFO:** Template TODOs in project-scaffold.ts are intentional scaffolding placeholders for users to customize

### Phase 56: Position → Seat
- **Note:** `client.ts` and `vue.ts` use `playerPosition` as internal variable names when handling server responses — acceptable per verification

## Gaps Closed

All gaps have been resolved:

1. **src/ai/mcts-bot.ts:1168** — Changed `player.position` to `player.seat`
2. **src/testing/debug.ts:83** — Changed `player.position` to `player.seat`

All 455 core tests pass. The milestone is ready for completion.
