**Resolution mapping:**

| Concern | Resolution | Phase |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Large files (4) | Split into smaller modules | v0.1 (Phases 1-4) |
| Type assertions: useActionController | Type guards replace as any | 05-01 |
| Type assertions: useZoomPreview | WeakMaps replace DOM storage | 05-02 |
| Type assertions: introspector | Documented as intentional | 05-03 |
| Silent error: boardRefs | Added console.error logging | 06-01 |
| JSON parsing: sqlite-storage | Added try/catch, returns null | 06-02 |
| Silent errors: worker/cli | Documented as best-effort | 06-03 |
| Missing docs: mcts-bot | Added section dividers & JSDoc | 07-01 |
| Incomplete API: assertions.ts | Removed unused parameter | 07-02 |
| Missing warning: code-generator | Added console.warn for fallback | 07-03 |

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update CONCERNS.md with resolution status</name>
  <files>.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md</files>
  <action>
Update each section in CONCERNS.md to reflect resolution status:

1. **Tech Debt > Large files**: Mark RESOLVED. Add note that all four files were split in v0.1 milestone.

2. **Tech Debt > Type assertions**: Mark RESOLVED. Document:
   - useActionController.ts: Fixed with type guards (05-01)
   - useZoomPreview.ts: Fixed with WeakMaps (05-02)
   - introspector.ts: Documented as intentional - runtime introspection requires dynamic access (05-03)

3. **Security > Silent error suppression**: Mark RESOLVED. Document:
   - selection-handler.ts (boardRefs): Added error logging (06-01)
   - worker/index.ts, cli/dev.ts: Documented as best-effort (06-03)

4. **Security > JSON parsing**: Mark RESOLVED. Note try/catch added in 06-02.

5. **Test Coverage Gaps > assertions.ts TODO**: Mark RESOLVED. Note unused parameter removed in 07-02.

6. **Test Coverage Gaps > code-generator fallback**: Mark RESOLVED. Note console.warn added in 07-03.

7. **Documentation Gaps**: Update to reflect:
   - mcts-bot.ts: RESOLVED - section dividers and JSDoc added (07-01)
   - game-session.ts: RESOLVED - file split in v0.1
   - flow/engine.ts: DEFERRED - not addressed in this milestone (acceptable - good existing test coverage)

8. Update the analysis date and add a note that v0.2 milestone addressed all actionable concerns.

Use "✅ RESOLVED" prefix for fixed items. Use "⏸️ DEFERRED" for items intentionally not addressed.

Update ROADMAP.md:
- Mark Phase 8 plan 08-01 as complete: `- [x] 08-01: ...`
- Update progress table: Phase 8 Status = Complete, add completion date
- Consider moving v0.2 to completed milestones section (similar to v0.1)

  <done>ROADMAP shows 08-01 checked, progress table shows Phase 8 complete</done>

Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] CONCERNS.md has resolution status for all items
- [ ] STATE.md shows Phase 8 complete
- [ ] ROADMAP.md shows Phase 8 complete
- [ ] All changes committed
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- CONCERNS.md accurately documents what was fixed and what was deferred
- Project state files (STATE.md, ROADMAP.md) reflect milestone completion
