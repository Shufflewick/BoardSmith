<objective>
Validate the complete tiered AI system works end-to-end with different game types.

Purpose: Verify Phases 24-27 produced a working system before shipping v1.0 milestone.
Output: Verified AI training for Hex (connection), Checkers (capture), and Go Fish (collection) games.

  <name>Task 1: Validate multi-game-type training</name>
  <files>packages/games/hex/rules/src/ai.ts, packages/games/go-fish/rules/src/ai.ts</files>
  <action>
Run train-ai for multiple game types to validate the complete pipeline:

**Hex (connection game):**
```bash
cd packages/games/hex
pnpm build
npx boardsmith train-ai --games 50 --iterations 2 --fresh -v
```
Verify: Game type detected as 'connection', path-distance features generated, training completes.

**Go Fish (collection game):**
```bash
cd packages/games/go-fish
pnpm build
npx boardsmith train-ai --games 50 --iterations 2 --fresh -v
```
Verify: Game type detected as 'collection', bookCount-related features generated, training completes.

**Checkers (capture game):**
```bash
cd packages/games/checkers
pnpm build
npx boardsmith train-ai --games 50 --iterations 2 -v
```
Verify: Game type detected as 'capture', threat/defense features generated, training completes without errors.

The goal is to confirm the feature template system correctly identifies game types and generates appropriate features. We're not optimizing for perfect AI performance - just validating the pipeline works.

**What to avoid:** Don't try to benchmark performance deeply - this is smoke-test validation that the system works end-to-end. WHY: v1.0 is about having a working tiered system, not optimal AI play.
  </action>
  <verify>
All three train-ai commands complete without errors. Generated ai.ts files contain game-type-specific features:
- Hex: path-distance or near-win features
- Go Fish: bookCount or collection features
- Checkers: threat, safety, or mobility features
  </verify>
  <done>
Three different game types successfully trained, demonstrating the tiered AI system handles connection, collection, and capture games.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update PROJECT.md and verify milestone readiness</name>
  <files>.planning/PROJECT.md, .planning/STATE.md</files>
  <action>
1. Update PROJECT.md Requirements section with v1.0 AI system accomplishments:
   - ✓ Game type auto-detection (connection, capture, collection, racing)
   - ✓ Type-specific feature generation via introspection
   - ✓ Parallel training with evolution support
   - ✓ /generate-ai slash command for LLM-assisted generation

2. Update STATE.md to reflect Phase 28 completion and v1.0 milestone readiness.

3. Run full test suite to confirm no regressions:
```bash
pnpm test
```

**What to avoid:** Don't add extensive new documentation - keep updates minimal and focused on what was actually shipped. WHY: Over-documenting creates maintenance burden.
  </action>
  <verify>
- PROJECT.md has v1.0 AI requirements listed
- STATE.md shows Phase 28 complete
- pnpm test passes all tests
  </verify>
  <done>
Documentation updated, tests pass, milestone v1.0 is ready to ship.
  </done>

Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] Hex train-ai completes and generates connection-appropriate features
- [ ] Go Fish train-ai completes and generates collection-appropriate features
- [ ] Checkers train-ai completes without errors
- [ ] All tests pass (pnpm test)
- [ ] PROJECT.md updated with v1.0 achievements
- [ ] STATE.md reflects completion
