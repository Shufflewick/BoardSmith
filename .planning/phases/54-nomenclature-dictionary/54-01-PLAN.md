<objective>
Create the authoritative BoardSmith terminology reference document.

Purpose: Define all standardized terms for the codebase before external adoption. This document becomes the single source of truth for terminology across documentation, code comments, and user communication.

Output: `docs/nomenclature.md` containing 35+ terms organized into 7 categories with consistent entry format.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create docs/nomenclature.md</name>
  <files>docs/nomenclature.md</files>
  <action>
Create the comprehensive terminology dictionary following this structure:

**Document Structure:**
1. Quick reference table at top (all terms alphabetically with one-line definitions)
2. Category sections (7 categories from research)
3. Related Documentation links at bottom

**Categories (from 54-RESEARCH.md):**
- Core Concepts (Table, Board, Zone, Session, Rules)
- Players (Player, Seat, Active Player, Owner)
- Game Flow (Phase, Round, Turn, Flow, Action)
- Elements (Element, Piece, Space, Card, Die)
- Zones/Spaces (Deck, Hand, Grid, HexGrid, DicePool)
- Actions and Selections (Action, Pick, Choice, Execute, Condition)
- UI Components (GameShell, GameTable, ActionPanel, AutoUI)

**Entry Format (per term):**
```markdown
### Term

**Definition:** Clear, user-focused explanation.

**In Code:** `ClassName` or `method()` - where this appears in code
**Related Terms:** Term1, Term2
**Usage:**
- Example sentence showing correct usage
```

**Critical: v2.3 Terminology Changes:**
Include notes on upcoming renames:
- Table: "Replaces GameBoard in v2.3"
- Seat: "Replaces position in v2.3"
- Pick: "Replaces selection in v2.3"

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Circular definitions (Zone is area, Area is zone)
- Implementation-only definitions (focus on user perspective first)
- Missing cross-references (every Related Term must have its own entry)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. File exists: `ls docs/nomenclature.md`
2. Has quick reference table: `grep -c "| Term | Definition |" docs/nomenclature.md` returns 1
3. Has all 7 categories: `grep -c "^## " docs/nomenclature.md` returns 8+ (intro + 7 categories + related docs)
4. v2.3 terms documented: `grep -c "v2.3" docs/nomenclature.md` returns 3+
  </verify>
  <done>
- docs/nomenclature.md exists with 200+ lines
- Quick reference table lists all 35+ terms
- 7 category sections with consistent entry format
- Table, Seat, Pick entries include v2.3 migration notes
- Cross-references are complete (no dangling Related Terms)
  </done>
</task>
