<objective>
Rename GameBoard.vue to GameTable.vue in all 4 extracted games that use that naming pattern.

Purpose: Align component naming with v2.3 nomenclature standard (Table = visual game area).

Output: All 4 games have GameTable.vue components with updated imports.

    Use `git mv` to rename each GameBoard.vue to GameTable.vue. This preserves git history.

    Commands:
    ```bash
    git mv packages/games/demoAnimation/src/ui/components/GameBoard.vue packages/games/demoAnimation/src/ui/components/GameTable.vue
    git mv packages/games/demoComplexUiInteractions/src/ui/components/GameBoard.vue packages/games/demoComplexUiInteractions/src/ui/components/GameTable.vue
    git mv packages/games/floss-bitties/src/ui/components/GameBoard.vue packages/games/floss-bitties/src/ui/components/GameTable.vue
    git mv packages/games/polyhedral-potions/ui/src/components/GameBoard.vue packages/games/polyhedral-potions/ui/src/components/GameTable.vue
    ```

    DO NOT rename:
    - AutoGameBoard.vue (different semantic purpose)
    - CheckersBoard.vue, CribbageBoard.vue, GoFishBoard.vue, HexBoard.vue (game-specific names)

    Update all imports and component usages from GameBoard to GameTable.

    **App.vue files (4 files):**
    - Change `import GameBoard from './components/GameBoard.vue'` to `import GameTable from './components/GameTable.vue'`
    - Change `<GameBoard` to `<GameTable` in template
    - Change any closing `</GameBoard>` to `</GameTable>` if present
    - Update any comment references to GameBoard

    **index.ts files (3 files - polyhedral-potions has no index.ts export):**
    - Change `export { default as GameBoard } from './components/GameBoard.vue'` to `export { default as GameTable } from './components/GameTable.vue'`

    **Also update internal comments** in the renamed GameTable.vue files if they reference "GameBoard" in comments or file headers.

  <name>Task 3: Build and verify all 4 renamed games</name>
  <files>None (verification only)</files>
  <action>
    Build each of the 4 renamed games to verify the changes work:

    ```bash
    cd packages/games/demoAnimation && npm run build
    cd packages/games/demoComplexUiInteractions && npm run build
    cd packages/games/floss-bitties && npm run build
    cd packages/games/polyhedral-potions && npm run build
    ```

    All builds must succeed. If any build fails, fix the issue (likely a missed import update).
  </action>
  <verify>
    All 4 build commands complete with exit code 0
    `dist/` folders are updated in each game
  </verify>
  <done>All 4 renamed games build successfully</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `find packages/games -name "GameBoard.vue"` returns empty
2. `find packages/games -name "GameTable.vue"` returns exactly 4 files
3. `grep -r "GameBoard" packages/games/*/src/ui/` returns empty (excluding games with custom names)
4. All 4 affected game builds succeed
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- No files named GameBoard.vue in packages/games/
- All imports reference GameTable.vue
- All 4 renamed games build without errors
- Git history preserved via git mv
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/55-gametable-rename/55-01-SUMMARY.md`
