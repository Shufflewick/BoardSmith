  - "Requirement UI-01 is N/A: No GameBoard.vue exists in core UI (src/ui/). The AutoGameBoard.vue component serves a different semantic purpose (automatic board rendering) and retains its name."

<objective>
Rename GameBoard.vue to GameTable.vue in all 4 extracted games that use that naming pattern.

Purpose: Align component naming with v2.3 nomenclature standard (Table = visual game area).

Output: All 4 games have GameTable.vue components with updated imports.

    Use `git mv` to rename each GameBoard.vue to GameTable.vue. This preserves git history.

    Commands:
    ```bash
    git mv packages/games/demoAnimation/src/ui/components/GameBoard.vue packages/games/demoAnimation/src/ui/components/GameTable.vue
    git mv packages/games/demoComplexUiInteractions/src/ui/components/GameBoard.vue packages/games/demoComplexUiInteractions/src/ui/components/GameTable.vue
    git mv packages/games/floss-bitties/src/ui/components/GameBoard.vue packages/games/floss-bitties/src/ui/components/GameTable.vue
    git mv packages/games/polyhedral-potions/ui/src/components/GameBoard.vue packages/games/polyhedral-potions/ui/src/components/GameTable.vue
    ```

    DO NOT rename:
    - AutoGameBoard.vue (different semantic purpose)
    - CheckersBoard.vue, CribbageBoard.vue, GoFishBoard.vue, HexBoard.vue (game-specific names)

    Update all imports and component usages from GameBoard to GameTable.

    **App.vue files (4 files):**
    - Change `import GameBoard from './components/GameBoard.vue'` to `import GameTable from './components/GameTable.vue'`
    - Change `<GameBoard` to `<GameTable` in template
    - Change any closing `</GameBoard>` to `</GameTable>` if present
    - Update any comment references to GameBoard

    **index.ts files (3 files - polyhedral-potions has no index.ts export):**
    - Change `export { default as GameBoard } from './components/GameBoard.vue'` to `export { default as GameTable } from './components/GameTable.vue'`

    **Also update internal comments** in the renamed GameTable.vue files if they reference "GameBoard" in comments or file headers.

  <name>Task 3: Build and verify all 9 extracted games</name>
  <files>None (verification only)</files>
  <action>
    Build ALL 9 extracted games to verify the rename didn't break anything:

    **4 renamed games (must pass - imports were updated):**
    ```bash
    cd packages/games/demoAnimation && npm run build
    cd packages/games/demoComplexUiInteractions && npm run build
    cd packages/games/floss-bitties && npm run build
    cd packages/games/polyhedral-potions && npm run build
    ```

    **5 games with custom names (regression check - should be unaffected):**
    ```bash
    cd packages/games/checkers && npm run build
    cd packages/games/cribbage && npm run build
    cd packages/games/go-fish && npm run build
    cd packages/games/hex && npm run build
    cd packages/games/demoActionPanel && npm run build
    ```

    The 5 custom-named games already use game-specific board names (CheckersBoard.vue, CribbageBoard.vue, GoFishBoard.vue, HexBoard.vue) or have no custom board component (demoActionPanel uses AutoUI). They should be completely unaffected by this rename, but building them confirms no accidental side effects.

    All builds must succeed. If any build fails, fix the issue (likely a missed import update).
  </action>
  <verify>
    All 9 build commands complete with exit code 0
    `dist/` folders are updated in each game
  </verify>
  <done>All 9 extracted games build successfully</done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. `find packages/games -name "GameBoard.vue"` returns empty
2. `find packages/games -name "GameTable.vue"` returns exactly 4 files
3. `grep -r "GameBoard" packages/games/*/src/ui/` returns empty (excluding games with custom names)
4. All 9 extracted game builds succeed
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- No files named GameBoard.vue in packages/games/
- All imports reference GameTable.vue
- All 9 extracted games build without errors
- Git history preserved via git mv
