<objective>
Add conditional color UI to Lobby (WaitingRoom) and PlayerStats (PlayersPanel)

Purpose: Complete the UI layer of player colors refactor - users can see and select colors in lobby when enabled, and see color indicators during gameplay.

Output: WaitingRoom auto-shows color picker when colorSelectionEnabled is true (using game's colors array), PlayersPanel shows color swatch conditionally.

  <name>Task 1: Extend LobbyInfo with color configuration</name>
  <files>
    src/session/types.ts
    src/session/lobby-manager.ts
  </files>
  <action>
1. In src/session/types.ts, add two new optional fields to LobbyInfo interface (after maxPlayers):
   - colorSelectionEnabled?: boolean - whether players can select colors
   - colors?: string[] - available color palette (hex strings)

2. In src/session/lobby-manager.ts getLobbyInfo() method, populate these new fields:
   - colorSelectionEnabled: this.#storedState.colorSelectionEnabled (from game settings)
   - colors: this.#storedState.colors (from game settings)

Note: The storedState already has access to colorSelectionEnabled and colors from Phase 64 engine layer. They're stored in game.settings and passed through to StoredGameState during game creation.

Check StoredGameState interface in types.ts - it may need colorSelectionEnabled and colors fields added if not already present. Add them if needed.
  </action>
  <verify>
TypeScript compiles without errors: `npm run build` passes.
  </verify>
  <done>
LobbyInfo includes colorSelectionEnabled and colors fields, and getLobbyInfo() populates them from stored state.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add auto-injected color option to WaitingRoom</name>
  <files>
    src/ui/components/WaitingRoom.vue
  </files>
  <action>
Update WaitingRoom to auto-show a color picker when colorSelectionEnabled is true:

1. Add colorSelectionEnabled and colors to the local LobbyInfo interface (already partially defined in the component):
   - colorSelectionEnabled?: boolean
   - colors?: string[]

2. Create a computed property `effectivePlayerOptions` that:
   - Returns props.playerOptions if colorSelectionEnabled is false or undefined
   - When colorSelectionEnabled is true, auto-injects a 'color' option using lobby.colors:
     ```typescript
     const colorOption = {
       type: 'color' as const,
       label: 'Color',
       choices: (props.lobby.colors || []).map(c => ({ value: c, label: c })),
     };
     return { color: colorOption, ...props.playerOptions };
     ```

3. Update the template where playerOptions are used:
   - Replace `standardPlayerOptions` references to use new computed that filters from `effectivePlayerOptions`
   - The existing color picker UI (lines 707-721) will render automatically since it handles `type: 'color'`

4. The existing `isChoiceTaken` and `getMyOptionValue` functions already work correctly for color checking.

Key: The color option should appear in the "Your Settings" panel below the name field when colorSelectionEnabled is true.
  </action>
  <verify>
Create a test game with colorSelectionEnabled: true (or use default since it defaults to true). Lobby should show color swatches in "Your Settings" section. Color picker should NOT appear when colorSelectionEnabled is explicitly false.
  </verify>
  <done>
WaitingRoom shows color picker when lobby.colorSelectionEnabled is true, using lobby.colors for the palette. Color picker is hidden when colorSelectionEnabled is false.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add conditional color indicator to PlayersPanel</name>
  <files>
    src/ui/components/PlayersPanel.vue
    src/ui/components/GameShell.vue
  </files>
  <action>
Update PlayersPanel to conditionally show player color based on colorSelectionEnabled prop:

1. In PlayersPanel.vue, add new optional prop:
   ```typescript
   colorSelectionEnabled?: boolean
   ```

2. Update the template (line 40):
   - Current: `<span v-if="player.color" class="player-color" ...>`
   - Change to: `<span v-if="colorSelectionEnabled && player.color" class="player-color" ...>`

3. In GameShell.vue, add state to track colorSelectionEnabled:
   - Add a ref: `const colorSelectionEnabled = ref(false)`
   - When lobby info is received (in the lobby state handling), set the ref:
     `colorSelectionEnabled.value = lobbyInfo.colorSelectionEnabled ?? false`
   - This ref persists through the transition from lobby to game state

4. In GameShell.vue, pass colorSelectionEnabled to PlayersPanel:
   - Find where PlayersPanel is used in the template
   - Add the prop binding: `:color-selection-enabled="colorSelectionEnabled"`
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Create game with colorSelectionEnabled: true (default) - PlayersPanel shows color swatches next to player names
2. Create game with colorSelectionEnabled: false - PlayersPanel hides color swatches (only shows names and turn indicators)
  </verify>
  <done>
PlayersPanel shows player color indicators when colorSelectionEnabled is true and hides them when false.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. TypeScript compiles: `npm run build` passes without errors
2. Create new game (default colorSelectionEnabled: true):
   - Lobby shows color swatches in "Your Settings"
   - Selecting a color updates playerOptions
   - During game, PlayersPanel shows color indicators
3. Modify a test game to use colorSelectionEnabled: false:
   - Lobby does NOT show color picker
   - During game, PlayersPanel does NOT show color indicators
4. Color conflict handling still works (from Phase 65):
   - Selecting a taken color shows error toast
