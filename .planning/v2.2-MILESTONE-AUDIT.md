# Milestone v2.2: Game Design Aspects — Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-01-21T11:45:00Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Verifier:** Claude (gsd-integration-checker)

## Summary

The v2.2 milestone successfully implemented composable aspect templates for `/design-game`. All requirements are satisfied, cross-phase integration is complete, and the E2E flow works end-to-end.

**Gap closure:** Phase 53 embedded all aspect templates inline in instructions.md, resolving the INT-02 gap from the initial audit.

## Scores

| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Requirements | 14/14 | COMPLETE |
| Phases | 3/3 | COMPLETE |
| Integration | 6/6 | COMPLETE |
| E2E Flows | 1/1 | COMPLETE |

## Requirements Coverage

### Aspect Detection (DET) — 4/4 SATISFIED

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| DET-01: Detect aspects from interview answers using keyword matching | SATISFIED | `instructions.md` Phase 2B includes keyword table (lines 232-235) |
| DET-02: Use Claude inference as fallback for ambiguous descriptions | SATISFIED | Phase 2B includes inference fallback instructions |
| DET-03: Multiple aspects can be detected from a single interview | SATISFIED | "Multiple aspects may apply" documented in Phase 2B |
| DET-04: Detected aspects stored for use in code generation | SATISFIED | PROJECT.md template includes "Detected Aspects" section (line 351) |

### Aspect Templates (TPL) — 6/6 SATISFIED

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| TPL-01: Each aspect lives in a separate template file | SATISFIED | 4 source files in `src/cli/slash-command/aspects/` |
| TPL-02: Dice aspect provides Die3D component, DicePool setup, roll action pattern | SATISFIED | Inline template at lines 1098-1312 (214+ lines) |
| TPL-03: PlayingCards aspect provides card fan, deck pile, draw/play patterns | SATISFIED | Inline template at lines 1314-1643 (329+ lines) |
| TPL-04: HexGrid aspect provides hex board layout, cell selection pattern | SATISFIED | Inline template at lines 1645-1912 (267+ lines) |
| TPL-05: SquareGrid aspect provides grid layout, cell selection pattern | SATISFIED | Inline template at lines 1914-2273 (359+ lines) |
| TPL-06: Each template includes links to relevant BoardSmith documentation | SATISFIED | Each template has "Documentation:" header with doc link |

### Integration (INT) — 4/4 SATISFIED

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| INT-01: Aspect contributions merge into Custom UI (GameBoard.vue) | SATISFIED | Instructions reference aspect templates for UI generation |
| INT-02: All detected aspects add their components to initial generation | SATISFIED | Templates embedded inline in instructions.md (Phase 53 fix) |
| INT-03: Aspects only affect initial generation — designer modifies from there | SATISFIED | Design documented in instructions |
| INT-04: Generation continues to work when no aspects detected (baseline) | SATISFIED | Fallback to existing generation documented |

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 51-aspect-templates | MISSING | COMPLETE | SUMMARY.md documents completion; artifacts exist |
| 52-detection-and-integration | MISSING | COMPLETE | SUMMARY.md documents completion; 52-01-PLAN.md fully checked |
| 53-deploy-aspect-templates | EXISTS | PASSED | 4/4 must-haves verified; gap closure complete |

## Cross-Phase Wiring

| Connection | From | To | Status |
|------------|------|----|----|
| Template files created | Phase 51 | Phase 52 | CONNECTED |
| Index file references templates | `aspects/index.md` | `aspects/*.md` | CONNECTED |
| Instructions reference templates | `instructions.md` | `aspects/*.md` | CONNECTED |
| Detection uses keywords | Phase 2B | `aspects/index.md` | CONNECTED |
| PROJECT.md stores aspects | Phase 4 | Phase 5 | CONNECTED |
| Template access at runtime | `instructions.md` | inline sections | CONNECTED |

## E2E Flow Analysis

### Flow: Game Design with Aspects — COMPLETE

| Step | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | User invokes `/design-game` | WORKS |
| 2 | Interview gathers game info | WORKS |
| 3 | Phase 2B detects aspects from keywords | WORKS |
| 4 | Aspects stored in PROJECT.md | WORKS |
| 5 | Claude reads aspect template sections (inline) | WORKS |
| 6 | Code generation uses template patterns | WORKS |
| 7 | Game files generated | WORKS |

**Flow verdict:** COMPLETE — all steps verified

## Tech Debt

None. All tech debt items from initial audit resolved:
- 52-01-PLAN.md success criteria now checked `[x]`
- Keywords synced between index.md and instructions.md (rolling, trump, discard, hexes, hexagonal, tiles added)

## Key Decision: Inline Templates

The gap closure phase chose to embed templates inline in instructions.md rather than modify the install command to copy the aspects/ directory. This maintains the v2.1 design decision of "self-contained slash commands" — the entire skill lives in one file with no external dependencies.

**Tradeoff:** instructions.md grew from ~1900 to 3077 lines, but Claude Code slash commands cannot read external files at runtime, so this is the only viable approach.
