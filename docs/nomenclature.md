## Core Concepts

Core concepts represent the foundational building blocks of any BoardSmith game.

### Table

**Definition:** The visual game area where all game components are displayed and player interactions occur. The table contains the board, player hands, and all other zones.

**In Code:** `GameTable.vue` component (v2.3)
**Related Terms:** Board, Zone, GameShell, Space
**Usage:**
- "The table shows all player hands and the central play area"
- "Configure the table layout in GameTable.vue"

**Note:** Replaces "GameBoard" in v2.3. The board is a component ON the table, not the table itself.

### Board

**Definition:** A Space that represents the main shared game area. Typically contains cells, squares, or positions where pieces are placed during play.

**In Code:** Extends `Space` class; often a custom class like `Board` or `GameBoard`
**Related Terms:** Table, Space, Grid, HexGrid
**Usage:**
- "Place the stone on the board"
- "The board has 8x8 cells"

### Zone

**Definition:** A logical area within the game that groups related elements and can have visibility rules applied. Zones organize game state into meaningful regions.

**In Code:** Conceptual; implemented as `Space` with visibility settings
**Related Terms:** Space, Hand, Deck, Visibility
**Usage:**
- "The discard zone is visible to all players"
- "Each player has a private zone for their resources"

### Session

**Definition:** A single game instance from start to finish. A session tracks the complete state of one game being played.

**In Code:** `GameSession` class; manages game lifecycle
**Related Terms:** Rules, Flow, Player
**Usage:**
- "Start a new session with 4 players"
- "The session ended when Player 1 reached 100 points"

### Rules

**Definition:** The complete game logic including element creation, action definitions, and flow structure. Rules define how a game works.

**In Code:** Your custom `Game` class extending `Game<G, P>`
**Related Terms:** Flow, Action, Session, Element
**Usage:**
- "The rules specify each player starts with 7 cards"
- "Check the rules for valid move destinations"

---

## Players

Terms related to game participants and their roles.

### Player

**Definition:** A participant in the game, either human or AI. Each player has a position, name, and game-specific properties like score or hand.

**In Code:** `Player` base class; extend to `MyPlayer extends Player<MyGame, MyPlayer>`
**Related Terms:** Seat, Active Player, Owner, Hand
**Usage:**
- "Player 1 draws a card"
- "The current player must choose an action"

### Seat

**Definition:** A player's numbered place at the table. Seats are 1-indexed (Seat 1, Seat 2, etc.) and determine turn order.

**In Code:** `player.position` property (1-indexed)
**Related Terms:** Player, Turn, Active Player
**Usage:**
- "The player in Seat 1 goes first"
- "Clockwise order starts from Seat 1"

**Note:** Replaces "position" in external communication in v2.3. Code still uses `player.position`.

### Active Player

**Definition:** The player whose turn it is and who can currently take actions. Only one player is active at a time in turn-based games.

**In Code:** `game.players.current` or `ctx.player` in action context
**Related Terms:** Player, Turn, Action
**Usage:**
- "The active player may draw or pass"
- "Wait for the active player to complete their turn"

### Owner

**Definition:** The player who controls or possesses a game element. Elements like hands belong to their owner, and pieces may be owned for scoring or control purposes.

**In Code:** `element.player` property on elements
**Related Terms:** Player, Piece, Hand, Visibility
**Usage:**
- "Only the owner can see their hand contents"
- "The piece's owner scores 2 points"

---

## Game Flow

Terms describing the structure and progression of gameplay.

### Phase

**Definition:** A named section of game flow that groups related activities. Phases organize gameplay into distinct stages like "deal", "play", and "score".

**In Code:** `phase('name', { do: ... })` flow node
**Related Terms:** Flow, Round, Turn, Action
**Usage:**
- "During the deal phase, each player receives 5 cards"
- "The scoring phase happens at the end of each round"

### Round

**Definition:** One complete cycle through all players. A round ends when every player has had their turn (or passes/is skipped).

**In Code:** Implemented via `eachPlayer` or `loop` with player iteration
**Related Terms:** Turn, Phase, Flow, Player
**Usage:**
- "Each round consists of one turn per player"
- "The game lasts 10 rounds"

### Turn

**Definition:** A player's opportunity to take one or more actions. During their turn, a player makes decisions and affects game state.

**In Code:** `actionStep({ actions: [...] })` in flow
**Related Terms:** Action, Active Player, Round, Flow
**Usage:**
- "On your turn, you must play a card"
- "End your turn by clicking 'Done'"

### Flow

**Definition:** The complete structure of game progression, defining the sequence of phases, turns, and actions from start to finish.

**In Code:** `FlowDefinition` with `root` node; set via `game.setFlow()`
**Related Terms:** Phase, Turn, Action, Rules
**Usage:**
- "The flow defines turn order and phase sequence"
- "Create the flow in a separate function for clarity"

### Action

**Definition:** Something a player can do during the game. Actions have a prompt, optional selections (picks), conditions, and an execute function.

**Usage:**
- "Move the piece to an empty cell"
- "Each player has 4 pieces of their color"

### Space

**Definition:** A container element that holds other elements. Spaces provide organization and can have visibility rules. All zones, decks, and hands are spaces.

**In Code:** `Space` class; base for `Deck`, `Hand`, `Grid`, `HexGrid`
**Related Terms:** Zone, Deck, Hand, Grid, Piece
**Usage:**
- "The discard pile is a space that holds played cards"

**In Code:** `Die` class with `value` and `roll()` method
**Related Terms:** Piece, DicePool, Element
**Usage:**
- "Roll the die and move that many spaces"
- "The die shows a value of 4"

### Pick

**Definition:** A choice that a player must make to complete an action. Picks can select from a list, choose an element, or enter a value.

**In Code:** Selection methods: `chooseFrom()`, `chooseElement()`, `fromElements()`, `enterNumber()`
**Related Terms:** Action, Choice, Execute, Condition
**Usage:**
- "Pick a card to discard"
- "The action requires two picks: source and destination"

**Note:** Replaces "selection" in user-facing communication in v2.3.

### Choice

**Definition:** A pick from a predefined list of options. Choices present named options for the player to select from.

**In Code:** `.condition({ 'label': (ctx) => boolean })`
**Related Terms:** Action, Pick, Flow
**Usage:**
- "The 'buy' action has a condition: player must have enough gold"
- "Actions with failed conditions are hidden"

### Command

**Definition:** A low-level, generic state mutation. Commands are automatically generated when you call element methods like `putInto()` or `shuffle()`.

**In Code:** Internal; `MoveCommand`, `ShuffleCommand`, `SetAttributeCommand`, etc.
**Related Terms:** Action, Execute, Element
**Usage:**
- "Calling card.putInto(hand) generates a MoveCommand"
