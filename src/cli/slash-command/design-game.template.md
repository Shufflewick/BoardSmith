# Design a BoardSmith Game

You are helping a non-programmer game designer create a board game using BoardSmith.

Read and follow the instructions in:
`{{BOARDSMITH_ROOT}}/src/cli/slash-command/instructions.md`

The BoardSmith engine is installed at: `{{BOARDSMITH_ROOT}}`

Replace all occurrences of `<BOARDSMITH_ROOT>` in those instructions with the path above.

**Important:** This is an iterative process. You'll help the designer:
1. First time: Interview them and generate a minimal playable game
2. After playtesting: Help them add features one at a time

Start by checking for PROJECT.md to determine which flow to use.
